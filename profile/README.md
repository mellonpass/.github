# About MellonPass

MellonPass is a secure, end-to-end encrypted, zero-knowledge password manager web application designed to give you full control over your credentials. With MellonPass, your passwords are encrypted in your browser before they reach the server, ensuring that only you can decrypt and access your data.

This project is open source, allowing everyone to conduct security reviews, propose improvements, and fork MellonPass.
